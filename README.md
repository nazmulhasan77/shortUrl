# Url Shortner

A URL shortener is a tool that takes a long URL and converts it into a shorter, more manageable link. This is particularly useful for sharing links in contexts where character count is limited, such as social media posts or text messages. Users typically paste their long URL into the URL shortener, which then generates a shorter version that redirects to the original URL when clicked. This makes links cleaner, easier to share, and more aesthetically pleasing. Additionally, URL shorteners often provide analytics, allowing users to track click-through rates and other metrics related to their shortened links.

# Hi, I'm Nazmul! ðŸ‘‹


## ðŸš€ About Me

Iâ€™m a Creative Designer
My name is Nazmul Hasan, and I am currently a student pursuing a degree in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) at Rajshahi University. I reside in the vibrant city of Rajshahi, which has become my second home during my university journey. However, my roots lie in the beautiful town of Rangpur, my hometown, which I hold close to my heart. As a CSE student, I am passionate about the ever-evolving world of technology and software development. When I'm not immersed in coding and coursework, I enjoy exploring new technologies and pursuing various interests. My time at Rajshahi University has been a fulfilling and enriching experience, and I look forward to the exciting adventures that the future holds for me in the world of computer science.
